# Patterns Overview

Simili Bot is designed to adapt to your organization's workflow. Whether you're managing a single project or a complex microservices architecture, there's a pattern that fits.

## The Three Patterns

Choose a pattern based on your repository structure and how much autonomy your individual teams require.

### Pattern A: Single Repository
The simplest setup, where the bot lives and runs entirely within one repository.

*   **Best For**: Small teams, standalone projects.
*   **Primary Benefit**: Zero external dependencies and fast setup.
*   **Permissions**: Default `GITHUB_TOKEN`.

### Pattern B: Centralized Multi-Repository
One "Control" repository manages issues across multiple "Target" repositories.

*   **Best For**: Organization-wide control, compliance, and unified routing.
*   **Primary Benefit**: One place to manage all configuration and automation.
*   **Permissions**: Elevated (GitHub App or PAT).

### Pattern C: Distributed Multi-Repository
Every repository has its own bot and config, but they all share a centralized knowledge base.

*   **Best For**: Microservices, high team autonomy, cross-team discovery.
*   **Primary Benefit**: Teams control their own bot while benefiting from organization-wide search.
*   **Permissions**: Default `GITHUB_TOKEN` per repo.
