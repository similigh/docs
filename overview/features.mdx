# Features Overview

Simili Bot provides a comprehensive suite of features for intelligent GitHub issue management.

## Semantic Search

Find related issues across your repositories using AI-powered semantic embeddings.

**How it works:**
- Issues are converted into 768-dimensional vectors using Google's text-embedding-004 model
- Similarity search queries the Qdrant vector database
- Results are ranked by semantic similarity score

**Benefits:**
- Discover related issues that use different terminology
- Prevent duplicate discussions scattered across conversations
- Build comprehensive issue context before implementation

**Configuration:**
```yaml
defaults:
  similarity_threshold: 0.70
  max_similar_to_show: 5
  cross_repo_search: true
```

## Duplicate Detection

Automatically identify when a new issue duplicates an existing one using AI analysis.

**Features:**
- Analyzes similar issues using LLM to determine if they're duplicates
- Returns confidence scores (0.0-1.0)
- Provides detailed reasoning for each duplicate assessment
- Comments on issues with findings

**Example Output:**
```
This issue appears to be related to #123.

Duplicate Confidence: 87%
Analysis: Both issues describe the same authentication timeout
problem in the login flow with identical error messages.
```

## Intelligent Routing

Automatically transfer issues to the correct repository based on content analysis.

**Two Modes:**

### 1. Rule-Based Routing
Match issues against explicit patterns:
- Label-based rules (all/any)
- Title/body keyword matching
- Author-based routing
- Priority-ordered evaluation

### 2. LLM-Based Routing
Use AI to understand issue content:
- Analyzes issue against repository descriptions
- Semantic understanding of domain
- Contextual routing decisions
- Prevents loops with blocked target tracking

**Configuration:**
```yaml
transfer:
  enabled: true
  llm_routing_enabled: true
  rules:
    - name: "Route to docs"
      priority: 10
      target: "org/docs-repo"
      title_contains: ["documentation", "docs"]
```

## Quality Assessment

Evaluate issue descriptions for completeness and clarity.

**Metrics Evaluated:**
- Description length and detail
- Use of formatting and structure
- Presence of reproduction steps
- Code examples or logs
- Expected vs actual behavior

**Output:**
- Quality score (0.0-1.0)
- List of quality issues found
- Improvement suggestions
- Example: "Add reproduction steps to improve clarity"

## Auto Triage

Automatically suggest appropriate labels based on issue content.

**Capabilities:**
- Analyzes issue title, description, and body
- Suggests labels matching your repository taxonomy
- Provides reasoning for suggestions
- Works with existing label set

**Example:**
```
Suggested Labels:
- bug (confidence: 95%)
- performance (confidence: 78%)
- high-priority (confidence: 65%)
```

## Multi-Repository Support

Manage issues across your entire organization with a single configuration.

**Features:**
- Central configuration with per-repository overrides
- Cross-repository semantic search
- Unified issue triage and analysis
- Organization-wide duplicate detection
- Coordinated routing across repos

**Configuration:**
```yaml
repositories:
  - org: "my-org"
    repo: "backend"
    enabled: true
    description: "Backend services and APIs"

  - org: "my-org"
    repo: "frontend"
    enabled: true
    description: "Web UI and client applications"
```

## Configuration Inheritance

Extend parent configurations from other repositories.

**Use Cases:**
- Organization-wide defaults
- Team-specific overrides
- Shared transfer rules

**Example:**
```yaml
extends: "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/my-org/configs/main/base.yaml"

# Override specific settings
repositories:
  - repo: "my-service"
    enabled: true
```

## Modular Pipeline

Customize issue processing with pluggable pipeline steps.

**Available Steps (13 total):**
1. **gatekeeper** - Repository enable/disable check
2. **command_handler** - Process bot commands in comments
3. **vectordb_prep** - Create collections as needed
4. **similarity_search** - Find related issues
5. **transfer_check** - Rule-based routing evaluation
6. **llm_router** - AI-based routing
7. **duplicate_detector** - Detect duplicates with confidence
8. **quality_checker** - Assess issue quality
9. **triage** - Suggest labels
10. **response_builder** - Build comprehensive report
11. **action_executor** - Post comments, transfer, apply labels
12. **indexer** - Add issue to vector database
13. **pending_action_scheduler** - Schedule delayed actions

**Workflow Presets:**
- `issue-triage` - Full pipeline (similarity, duplicates, triage, routing)
- `similarity-only` - Semantic search only
- `index-only` - Indexing to vector database

## Bulk Indexing

Index all issues in a repository to the vector database for semantic search.

**Features:**
- Process issues since a specific time
- Parallel indexing with configurable workers
- Automatic chunking of long issue text
- Include comments in embeddings

**Command:**
```bash
simili index --repo owner/name --since 30d --workers 5
```

## GitHub Integration

Native GitHub integration for actions and information retrieval.

**Capabilities:**
- Fetch issue details and comments
- Post analysis comments automatically
- Apply suggested labels
- Transfer issues to other repositories (GraphQL)
- Support for both public and private repositories
- Cross-repository operations with elevated permissions

## Dry-Run Mode

Test changes safely without posting to GitHub.

**Use Cases:**
- Preview what actions would be taken
- Test configuration changes
- Validate custom workflows
- Debug issues

**Command:**
```bash
simili process --issue event.json --config config.yaml --dry-run
```
