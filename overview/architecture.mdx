# Architecture Overview

Simili Bot uses a modular, pipeline-based architecture designed for flexibility and extensibility.

## System Design

### Global Architecture
![Architecture Diagram](file:///Users/kaviru/Downloads/docs/public/images/simili-architecture.png)

Simili Bot connects GitHub events to AI analysis (Gemini) and Vector Storage (Qdrant) through a highly modular pipeline engine.

<!-- slide -->
### Pipeline Steps (13 Total)
The pipeline runs through 13 discrete steps to ensure thorough processing:

1. **Gatekeeper**: Auth & repo check
2. **Command Handler**: Bot command parsing
3. **Search & Detect**: Semantic search & duplicates
4. **Triage & Quality**: AI labeling & assessment
5. **Execute**: Post results back to GitHub
6. **Index**: Store for future searches

## Core Components

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Configuration Layer">
    Handles YAML loading, environment variable expansion, and complex inheritance logic using the `extends` keyword.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Pipeline Engine">
    A step-based execution model where each step implements a common interface and operates on a shared `Context` object.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Integration Layer">
    High-performance clients for Gemini (AI), Qdrant (Vector DB), and GitHub (API v3/GraphQL).
  </Accordion>
