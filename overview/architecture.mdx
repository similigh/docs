# Architecture Overview

Simili Bot uses a modular, pipeline-based architecture designed for flexibility and extensibility. It is built to handle organization-scale issue management while maintaining a small, efficient footprint.

## System design

Simili Bot acts as a bridge between GitHub events and AI-powered analysis engines. It processes events sequentially through a customizable pipeline.

### High-level architecture

1.  **Event Source**: GitHub Actions or the Simili CLI provides the issue context.
2.  **Pipeline Engine**: Processes the data through 13 discrete steps.
3.  **Integrations**: Communicates with external services like Gemini (AI), Qdrant (Vector DB), and GitHub (API).

### Pipeline steps

The pipeline is composed of distinct modules that handle specific logic:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Validation">
    **Gatekeeper**: Verifies that the repository and user are authorized in the configuration.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Command Parsing">
    **Command Handler**: Identifies and processes specific `@simili-bot` commands in issue comments.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Analysis">
    **Search & Detect**: Performs semantic search and identifies potential duplicates.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Assessment">
    **Triage & Quality**: Uses AI to assess issue description quality and suggest labels.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Action">
    **Execute**: Posts results back to GitHub, applies labels, or transfers issues.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Persistence">
    **Index**: Stores the issue embeddings in Qdrant for future semantic searches.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Core components

### Configuration layer
Handles YAML loading, environment variable expansion, and complex inheritance logic using the `extends` keyword. This allows large organizations to maintain one base config that all other repositories inherit from.

### Pipeline engine
A step-based execution model where each step implements a common interface and operates on a shared `Context` object. This ensures that new features can be added as isolated modules without complexity creep.

### Integration layer
High-performance clients for:
*   **Gemini**: AI-powered text analysis and embeddings.
*   **Qdrant**: Low-latency vector search.
*   **GitHub**: Comprehensive management via REST (v3) and GraphQL APIs.
