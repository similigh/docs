# Transfer Rules

Configure automatic issue routing to the correct repositories.

## Overview

Issue routing helps:
- Move issues to correct repositories automatically
- Prevent wrong-repo issues
- Reduce manual sorting
- Improve issue organization

Two routing modes:
1. **Rule-Based**: Pattern matching on metadata
2. **LLM-Based**: Semantic analysis with AI

## Enable transfer

```yaml
transfer:
  enabled: true
  llm_routing_enabled: true
  rules: []
```

With `enabled: false`, no routing happens.

## Rule-based routing

Match issues against explicit patterns:

```yaml
transfer:
  enabled: true
  llm_routing_enabled: false  # Use rules only
  rules:
    - name: "Route documentation issues"
      priority: 10
      target: "org/docs"
      title_contains: ["documentation", "docs", "guide"]
      enabled: true

    - name: "Route GitHub Actions issues"
      priority: 5
      target: "org/workflows"
      body_contains: ["github actions", "workflow", ".yml"]
```

### Rule matching logic

All conditions must match (AND logic):

```yaml
- name: "Backend bug fixes"
  priority: 10
  target: "org/backend"
  labels: ["bug"]              # AND: must have "bug" label
  title_contains: ["API", "error"]  # AND: title must contain either word
  author: "john"               # AND: author must be "john"
```

If all conditions match → issue is routed to target.

### Condition types

#### 1. Labels (AND - all required)

```yaml
labels: ["bug", "urgent"]  # Must have BOTH labels
```

#### 2. Labels any (OR - any required)

```yaml
labels_any: ["bug", "feature"]  # Must have either label
```

#### 3. Title contains

```yaml
title_contains: ["api", "error"]  # Title must contain "api" OR "error"
```

#### 4. Body contains

```yaml
body_contains: ["authentication", "login"]  # Body must contain either
```

#### 5. Author

```yaml
author: "bot-user"  # Exact username match
```

### Priority

Rules evaluated by priority (highest first):

```yaml
rules:
  - name: "High priority rule"
    priority: 100
    target: "org/urgent"

  - name: "Medium priority rule"
    priority: 50
    target: "org/standard"

  - name: "Default rule"
    priority: 1
    target: "org/general"
```

First matching rule wins.

## LLM-based routing

Use AI to understand issue content:

```yaml
transfer:
  enabled: true
  llm_routing_enabled: true
  rules: []  # Optional, LLM acts as fallback
```

LLM routing:
- Analyzes issue against repository descriptions
- Understands semantic context
- Makes intelligent decisions
- Configurable as primary or fallback

### Combined approach

Use both rule-based and LLM:

```yaml
transfer:
  enabled: true
  llm_routing_enabled: true
  rules:
    - name: "Obvious routing"
      priority: 100
      target: "org/docs"
      title_contains: ["documentation"]

    # If no rules match, LLM decides
```

## Complete rule example

```yaml
transfer:
  enabled: true
  llm_routing_enabled: true
  rules:
    # Documentation issues
    - name: "Route documentation"
      priority: 100
      target: "my-org/docs"
      title_contains: ["documentation", "docs", "guide", "tutorial"]
      enabled: true

    # Backend/API issues
    - name: "Backend issues"
      priority: 90
      target: "my-org/backend"
      labels: ["backend"]
      title_contains: ["api", "server", "database"]
      enabled: true

    # Frontend issues
    - name: "Frontend issues"
      priority: 85
      target: "my-org/frontend"
      labels: ["frontend"]
      title_contains: ["ui", "button", "component", "react"]
      enabled: true

    # Security issues (labeled as such)
    - name: "Security"
      priority: 95
      target: "my-org/security"
      labels: ["security"]
      enabled: true

    # Issues from automation
    - name: "Bot created issues"
      priority: 10
      target: "my-org/triage"
      author: "github-actions"
      enabled: true
```

## Avoiding routing loops

Prevent infinite routing:

```yaml
rules:
  - name: "Route to other repo"
    priority: 10
    target: "org/other-repo"
    title_contains: ["routing"]
```

Simili Bot automatically:
- Tracks which repo an issue came from
- Prevents routing back to same repo
- Maintains blocked_targets list
- Won't route same issue twice

## Disable specific rules

Temporarily disable a rule:

```yaml
rules:
  - name: "Experimental routing"
    priority: 50
    target: "org/experimental"
    enabled: false  # Won't be evaluated
```

## Common patterns

### By feature area

```yaml
rules:
  - name: "Auth issues"
    target: "org/auth"
    title_contains: ["login", "authentication", "password", "oauth"]
    labels_any: ["auth", "security"]

  - name: "Payment issues"
    target: "org/payments"
    title_contains: ["billing", "payment", "invoice", "subscription"]
    labels_any: ["billing"]

  - name: "Notification issues"
    target: "org/notifications"
    title_contains: ["email", "notification", "sms", "alert"]
```

### By issue type

```yaml
rules:
  - name: "Bugs to QA"
    priority: 100
    target: "org/qa"
    labels: ["bug"]

  - name: "Features to product"
    priority: 95
    target: "org/product-backlog"
    labels: ["feature-request"]

  - name: "Questions to support"
    priority: 90
    target: "org/support"
    labels: ["question"]
```

### By team

```yaml
rules:
  - name: "Backend team"
    target: "org/backend"
    labels: ["team:backend"]

  - name: "Frontend team"
    target: "org/frontend"
    labels: ["team:frontend"]
```

## Configuration reference

```yaml
transfer:
  enabled: boolean              # Enable/disable routing
  llm_routing_enabled: boolean  # Use AI for routing
  rules: array                  # Array of rules
```

### Rule fields

```yaml
- name: string                  # Rule name (for logs)
  priority: number              # Evaluation order (higher first)
  target: "org/repo"           # Target repository
  enabled: boolean              # Enable/disable this rule
  labels: array                 # AND condition
  labels_any: array            # OR condition
  title_contains: array        # Title text matching
  body_contains: array         # Body text matching
  author: string               # Author matching
```

## Testing rules

### Dry-run mode

Test without transferring:

```bash
simili process --issue event.json --config simili.yaml --dry-run
```

Output shows:
```
[DRY RUN] Would route to org/backend
[DRY RUN] Would post comment: "Moved to correct repository"
```

### Check logs

Logs show routing decisions:
```
Evaluating rule: "Backend issues"
  Condition check: labels → PASS
  Condition check: title_contains → PASS
  Rule matches → Route to org/backend
```

## Troubleshooting

### Rule not matching

**Debug steps:**
1. Check rule is `enabled: true`
2. Verify all conditions are correct
3. Use dry-run to see which rules match
4. Check logs for condition evaluation

### Wrong repository selected

**Causes:**
- Higher priority rule matches first
- Adjust rule priorities
- Add more specific conditions
- Enable LLM fallback for context

### Issue not transferred

**Causes:**
- Rule didn't match
- Transfer disabled (`enabled: false`)
- Permission denied
- Loop prevention blocked transfer

**Solutions:**
- Enable transfer
- Check GitHub token permissions
- Verify target repo exists
- Check rule conditions

## Performance notes

- Rule evaluation is fast (&lt;100ms)
- LLM routing takes 2-5 seconds
- Combine for best results:
  - Rules for obvious cases
  - LLM as fallback/intelligent

## Best practices

### 1. Use clear rule names

```yaml
# Good
- name: "Route documentation issues to docs repository"

# Vague
- name: "docs"
```

### 2. Start with high priorities

```yaml
rules:
  - priority: 100  # Most specific
  - priority: 50
  - priority: 1    # Most general
```

### 3. Combine conditions carefully

```yaml
# Good - all conditions make sense
- target: "org/backend"
  labels: ["backend"]
  title_contains: ["api"]

# Over-specific - might never match
- target: "org/backend"
  labels: ["backend", "api", "urgent"]
  title_contains: ["rest", "http"]
```

### 4. Monitor routing

Check logs regularly:
- Are issues going to right repos?
- Any unexpected routings?
- Adjust rules as needed

### 5. Use LLM as fallback

```yaml
transfer:
  enabled: true
  llm_routing_enabled: true
  rules: []  # Let LLM handle all
```

Or use with rules:
```yaml
rules:
  - name: "Obvious patterns"
    priority: 100
    # ... conditions
```
