# Duplicate Detection

Simili Bot uses AI to automatically identify when a new issue is a duplicate of an existing one.

## How it works

1. **Find Similar Issues** - Use semantic search to find related issues
2. **Analyze with AI** - Use Gemini LLM to determine if truly duplicates
3. **Calculate Confidence** - Return confidence score (0.0-1.0)
4. **Post Comment** - Notify about duplicates with reasoning

## Example

**New Issue: "Can't log in with email"**

Simili Bot finds similar issues and analyzes:
- #456: "Email login broken" (94% similarity, 87% duplicate confidence)
- #123: "Authentication issues" (88% similarity, 76% duplicate confidence)

Posts comment:
```
🔍 Duplicate Analysis

This issue appears to be a duplicate of #456:

Duplicate Confidence: 87%
Both issues describe email authentication failures with identical symptoms.

Suggested Action: Close as duplicate and reference #456
```

## Configuration

Control duplicate detection via workflow selection:

```yaml
# In workflow
- uses: similigh/simili-bot@v0.1.0
  with:
    workflow: "issue-triage"  # Includes duplicate detection
    # or
    workflow: "similarity-only"  # Skip duplicate detection
```

## Confidence scores

- **90-100%**: Very likely duplicate
- **75-90%**: Probably duplicate
- **50-75%**: Possibly related
- **&lt;50%**: Not a duplicate

## Benefits

✅ Prevent scattered discussions
✅ Consolidate related issues
✅ Reduce duplicate work
✅ Improve issue tracking
