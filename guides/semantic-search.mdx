# Semantic Search

Simili Bot uses semantic search to find related issues across your repositories based on meaning, not just keywords.

## How It Works

````carousel
### Theory vs Reality
**Traditional Search:**
Only finds issues with exact word matches (e.g., searching "login" misses "authentication failures").

**Semantic Search:**
AI understands that "Can't authenticate" is semantically related to "Sign-in issues" and "Login broken".

### The Process
![Semantic Search Process](file:///Users/kaviru/Downloads/docs/public/images/semantic-search-flow.png)

1. **Embedding**: Text (title, body, comments) is converted into a 768-dimensional vector.
2. **Indexing**: Vectors are stored in Qdrant with issue metadata.
3. **Querying**: New issues are compared against the entire database in milliseconds.

## Configuration

````carousel
### Tuning Thresholds
Lower threshold = more results, higher threshold = more precise.

| Level | Value | Effect |
|-------|-------|--------|
| Conservative | 0.80 | Only direct matches |
| Recommended | 0.70 | Good balance |
| Permissive | 0.60 | Loose relations |

### YAML Example
```yaml
defaults:
  similarity_threshold: 0.70      # Minimum confidence
  max_similar_to_show: 5          # Maximum results
  cross_repo_search: true         # Search across repos
```

## Use Cases

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Finding Duplicate Issues">
    Instantly identify if a new bug report has already been discussed in another repo, even if the wording is completely different.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Pattern Recognition">
    Detect if multiple teams are experiencing related infrastructure failures by seeing cross-repo search results in real-time.
  </Accordion>
