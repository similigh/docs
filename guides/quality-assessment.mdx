# Quality Assessment

Simili Bot evaluates issue descriptions for completeness and clarity.

## How it works

Simili Bot analyzes:
- **Length & Detail** - Is description comprehensive?
- **Structure** - Proper formatting and organization?
- **Steps** - Reproduction steps included?
- **Examples** - Code samples or logs provided?
- **Context** - Environment and versions specified?

## Example output

```
## Quality Assessment
Quality Score: 72/100

Issues Found:
- Missing reproduction steps
- No error message provided
- Environment not specified

Suggestions:
- Include step-by-step reproduction
- Add the exact error message
- Specify your OS and version
```

## Configuration

Quality assessment is part of "issue-triage" workflow:

```yaml
- uses: similigh/simili-bot@v0.1.0
  with:
    workflow: "issue-triage"  # Includes quality check
```

## Scoring

- **90-100**: Excellent - comprehensive and clear
- **70-90**: Good - mostly complete
- **50-70**: Fair - missing some details
- **&lt;50**: Poor - unclear and incomplete
