# Automatic Issue Routing

Simili Bot intelligently routes issues to the correct repositories based on content and rules.

## How it works

1. **Rule Evaluation** - Check against explicit routing rules
2. **LLM Analysis** (optional) - Use AI for semantic routing
3. **Transfer** - Move issue to target repository
4. **Prevent Loops** - Avoid routing same issue multiple times

## Example

**New Issue in org/general**:
```
Title: How do I configure authentication?
Body: I'm trying to set up OAuth...
```

**Routing Decision**: Issue contains "authentication" keywords
- Rule matches: "Route to auth repository"
- Issue transferred to: `org/authentication`

## Configuration

```yaml
transfer:
  enabled: true
  llm_routing_enabled: true  # AI fallback
  rules: []
```

See [Transfer Rules](/configuration/transfer-rules) for detailed setup.

## Two modes

### Rule-based
Pattern matching on labels, title, body, author.
- Fast (<100ms)
- Explicit control
- Predictable

### LLM-based
AI understands issue semantics and repository descriptions.
- Intelligent (<5s)
- Context-aware
- Flexible

Use both together for best results!

## Benefits
