# Auto Triage

Simili Bot automatically analyzes issues and suggests appropriate labels.

## How it works

1. **Read Issue** - Extract title, description, and context
2. **Analyze** - Use AI to understand issue type and context
3. **Suggest Labels** - Return labels with confidence scores
4. **Post Comment** - Show suggestions for manual review
5. **Optional Action** - Can auto-apply labels if desired

## Example

**New Issue: "Database queries are slow"**

Simili Bot suggests:
```
## Suggested Labels
- performance (95% confidence)
- database (92% confidence)
- bug (78% confidence)
- needs-investigation (65% confidence)
```

## Configuration

Auto-triage is part of "issue-triage" workflow:

```yaml
- uses: similigh/simili-bot@v0.1.0
  with:
    workflow: "issue-triage"  # Includes auto-triage
```

## Smart suggestions

Works with your repository's labels:
- Analyzes existing labels
- Learns from historical issues
- Respects your labeling conventions
- Suggests only labels that exist

## Benefits
