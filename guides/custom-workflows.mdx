# Custom Workflows

Create custom workflows by selecting which pipeline steps to run.

## Pipeline steps

Simili Bot has 13 modular steps you can mix and match:

1. **gatekeeper** - Check if repo is enabled
2. **command_handler** - Process bot commands
3. **vectordb_prep** - Create collections
4. **similarity_search** - Find related issues
5. **transfer_check** - Rule-based routing
6. **llm_router** - AI routing
7. **duplicate_detector** - Identify duplicates
8. **quality_checker** - Assess quality
9. **triage** - Suggest labels
10. **response_builder** - Build comment
11. **action_executor** - Post to GitHub
12. **indexer** - Add to vector DB
13. **pending_action_scheduler** - Schedule actions

## Preset workflows

Use built-in presets:

```bash
simili process --workflow issue-triage    # Full pipeline
simili process --workflow similarity-only # Search only
simili process --workflow index-only      # Indexing only
```

Or in GitHub Actions:
```yaml
- uses: similigh/simili-bot@v0.1.0
  with:
    workflow: "issue-triage"
```

## Workflow presets

### issue-triage (Default)
Complete issue analysis pipeline:
- Find similar issues
- Check for duplicates
- Assess quality
- Suggest labels
- Route if configured

### similarity-only
Semantic search only:
- Find related issues
- No AI analysis
- Fast and lightweight

### index-only
Indexing to vector database:
- Add issues to Qdrant
- No analysis or comments

## Custom workflows

Define custom workflows in configuration (future feature):

```yaml
# Planned: Custom workflow support
workflows:
  fast-only:
    steps:
      - gatekeeper
      - vectordb_prep
      - similarity_search
      - response_builder
      - action_executor

  full-analysis:
    steps:
      - gatekeeper
      - command_handler
      - vectordb_prep
      - similarity_search
      - transfer_check
      - llm_router
      - duplicate_detector
      - quality_checker
      - triage
      - response_builder
      - action_executor
      - indexer
```

## Tips for efficiency

**Reduce API Calls:**
- Use `similarity-only` when you don't need AI analysis
- Disable unnecessary steps

**Improve Speed:**
- Skip steps you don't need
- Use dry-run for testing

**Optimize Costs:**
- Every Gemini API call has cost
- Use lightweight workflows for high-volume repos
