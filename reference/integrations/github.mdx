# GitHub Integration

How Simili Bot integrates with GitHub for issue management.

## Overview

Simili Bot uses GitHub API to:
- Fetch issue details and comments
- Post analysis comments
- Apply suggested labels
- Transfer issues to other repositories
- Handle authentication and permissions

## API Methods

**REST API** (v3)
- Fetch issues and comments
- Create/update comments
- Add labels to issues
- List repositories

**GraphQL API**
- Transfer issues across repositories
- Complex queries
- Batch operations

## Authentication

Two authentication modes:

### Primary Token
```bash
GITHUB_TOKEN=ghp_xxxx
```

For normal operations (read/write issues, create comments).

**Required Scopes:**
- `repo` - Full control of repositories
- `write:checks` - Write to pull requests

### Elevated Token (Optional)
```bash
TRANSFER_TOKEN=ghp_xxxx
```

For transferring issues across repositories.

**Required Scopes:**
- `repo` - Full control of repositories

## Capabilities

**Issue Operations**
- Fetch issue by number
- Get issue comments (paginated)
- Create comment with analysis
- Apply multiple labels
- Update issue state

**Transfer**
- Move issue to different repository
- Prevent circular transfers
- Update references

**Metadata**
- Extract labels
- Get author information
- Read issue state and history

## Rate Limiting

**REST API:**
- 5,000 requests/hour (authenticated)
- 60 requests/hour (unauthenticated)

**GraphQL API:**
- Rate points: 5,000 per hour
- Complex queries cost more

**Optimization:**
- Batch operations
- Cache results
- Use appropriate endpoints

## Security

**Credential Management:**
- Tokens stored as GitHub secrets
- Never hardcoded in configuration
- Rotated regularly

**Permissions:**
- Only request necessary scopes
- Use elevated token only for transfers
- Regular audit of token usage

## Integration Points

1. **Issue Fetching** - Get issue details
2. **Comment Posting** - Post analysis results
3. **Label Management** - Apply suggested labels
4. **Issue Transfer** - Move to correct repo
5. **Comment Reading** - Parse bot commands

## Examples

**Fetch Issue:**
```
GET /repos/owner/repo/issues/42
Returns: Issue object with details
```

**Post Comment:**
```
POST /repos/owner/repo/issues/42/comments
Body: Analysis comment text
```

**Add Labels:**
```
POST /repos/owner/repo/issues/42/labels
Labels: ["bug", "urgent"]
```

**Transfer Issue:**
```
GraphQL mutation to move issue
From: org/repo1
To: org/repo2
```
